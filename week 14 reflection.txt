Please respond thoroughly (at least two sentences for each question) to
the following three questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.
Before the semester, i didnt know about functions and i had little to no knowledge about functions and what they do.
I must say i saw the real power of functions when i came to learn and understand what functions are a what they are
used for. I will also say that i saw the power of functions when i started using them to write programs.


2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?
Test functions are very valuable and very important. Test functions are used to test for program functions if they run
correctly and produce the expected outcome. So in summary, test functions check the validity of program functions
and check if they work well.


3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?

When you write a program and it produces faults, you must check to see if it is a logical or syntax error.
Now with the process of troubleshooting, we can use the red dot on the side on visual studio code which is named
the debugger. The debugger tells the programmer where the fault is located for the programmer to find and fix those errors.
One thing you can do to improve the process is to use the try and except keywords so that they can catch and reveal
error made by the user.
